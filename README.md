##AHL Coderprize

The Man AHL Coder Prize 2015 challanged students in the UK and Ireland to create an algorithm, written in Python, to conquer the classic game Hexplode. They provided a simulator, where you could run a single match with an interface or a batch of matches with their final results.

I implemented several different types of algorithms that could beat other players in this game. When I created a new algorithm, I always made sure that it would win for the past algorithms implemented. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go to the finals. I had a lot of fun with this challenge though.
